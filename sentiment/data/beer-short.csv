"Medium brown head.  Black body goes clear deep dark red at edges. Deep caramelly fruity vanilla fudge aroma with chocolatey red berry notes.  Dry-sweet earthy butterscotch and soy sauce taste with dusty red berry notes.  Full-bodied.  Dry roasty soy sauce and earth aftertaste with cardamom, vanilla fudge, and dried fruit notes.  Aftertaste could use a little more bit, otherwise very nice and and drinkable.  &#40;0.75l bottle, from somewhere in Copenhagen, I think.&#41;",14

"Big offwhite head.  Clear amber body with carbonation.  Grainy, vaguely malty aroma, very faint.  Dry-sweet fruity sugary papery taste.  Mid-bodied.  Mild, slightly empty mouthfeel.  Dry fruity grainy papery aftertaste with spicy notes.  It's OK, but a bit weird.  With the ingredients listed on the can it ought to taste a lot better than this.  &#40;0.33l can, Systembolaget, Charlottenberg.&#41;",11

"Huge offwhite lasting head.  Slightly hazy yellow body.  Deep fruity oily sugary aroma with earthy notes.  Dry-bitter fruity earthy funky taste with oily grassy notes.  Mid-bodied.  Mild, slightly sharp, mouthfeel.  Dry oily fruity aftertaste with grassy earthy notes.  It's not bad, but the hops are too sharp, and it's not at all what I was hoping for from an unfiltered lager.  &#40;0.33l bottle, Systembolaget, Charlottenberg.&#41;",12
